The purpose of this repository will be to track all of my progress towards 
assembling and A B and L race genome combining the ONT sequencing data 
with the short read Illumina data. A hybrid assembly approach combining Canu and/or
SOAPdenovo with Pilon will be employed.

First I need to organize and obtain iniitial metrics on the quality and coverage for each
chemical race using programs FastQC/LongQC.

After various attempts and optimizations, certain job scripts, and directories 
were not used in the finally assembly, and will be marked here as (D) for deactivated.

These include the following:
 - BarcodeTrimming/ 
 - Canu-GridRemote/
 - QCAnalysis/PostTrimming_Porechop/
 - Canu-64GBNode/
