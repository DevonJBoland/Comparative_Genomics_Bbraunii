# The purpose of this directory is to house all job scripts for assembling unitigs
# from the ONT data for L race, on the Grace server.
# Until the end of the semester, I can only test Canu and cannot do any donwstream
# analysis.

# Eventually Ada will be retired and all jobs will be sumbitted on Grace,
# In the meantime, I will test the feasibilty on assembling L race unitigs
# on the Grace system using large memory 3TB nodes and with the added
# ability to make use of Canu's grid option.
